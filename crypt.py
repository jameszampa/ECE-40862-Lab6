class CryptAes:
    """Uses AES encryption to encrypt Payload/Data before sending using MQTT protocol
    The AES algo uses Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
    AES encryption correctly requires three things to produce ciphertext:
    a message: Payload/Data which is to be encrypted,
    a key: Piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a
        cryptographic algorithm. For encryption algorithms, a key specifies transformation
        of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption algorithms.
    initialization vector (IV): Piece of data sent along with the key that modifies the end
        ciphertext result. As the name suggests, it initializes the state of the encryption
        algorithm before the data enters. This protects against attacks like pattern analysis.
        This needs to be DIFFERENT for every message.
        
    Uses sessionID (received from Spinner #2) and Encrypted Data to generate HMAC for 
    authentication of the sending device (Spinner #1)
    SessionID is generated by Spinner #2 by posting to the MQTT topic, SessionID every 1 sec.
    
    HMAC (hash-based message authentication code): Type of message authentication code (MAC)
    involving a cryptographic HASH function and a secret cryptographic key. It may be used to
    simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authentication of a message.
